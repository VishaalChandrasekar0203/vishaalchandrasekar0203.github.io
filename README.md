## Featured Projects

### Controlling Adversarial AI 
Developing robust security and defence control mechanisms for generative AI, focusing on mitigating risks in children's narratives.

[View Project](https://github.com/VishaalChandrasekar0203/Controlling-Adversary-AI)

### LLMs Cache Prefetching
Cold and warm cache mechanisms, along with prefetching, optimize Large Language Model (LLM) performance. It highlights latency differences and efficient data retrieval for faster, smarter AI responses.

### Data Pedigree Analysics 
Tracking Data lineage / Origin

[View Project](https://github.com/VishaalChandrasekar0203/Data_Pedigree_Analysis)

### Fine Tuning a Pre-Trained LLM for Named Entity Recognition
This project will involve fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (e.g., bert-base-cased) on the CoNLL-2003 dataset for NER. The model will learn to predict entity tags (e.g., PER, ORG, LOC) for each token in the input text.

### Campaign Financing Predictive Analysis
Enhanced a Large Language Model (LLM) to implement GPT 3.5 for predictive analysis on Campaign Financing data, achieving a performance rate 10 times greater through the effective generation of synthetic data using diffusion models.
